altlaw-jruby: Custom build of JRuby for AltLaw

AltLaw requires JRuby to be packaged as one complete JAR, including
several Rubygem libraries.  This Maven/Ant installation script builds
a development version of JRuby with all the necessary gems
pre-installed and correctly packaged in the JAR.

To install it, simply run "mvn install".



This source code repository contains code used to develop AltLaw.org,
a free legal research web site.
